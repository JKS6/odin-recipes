    <h2>Time table</h2>
    <p>
    Bulk fermentation 2 hours <br>
    Divide, shape and cover dough 10 minutes <br>
    Second fermentation 16 to 48 hours refrigerated <br> 
    <br>
    Sample Schedule <br>
    Mix the dough at 7p, <br> 
    shape into dough balls at 9p, <br> 
    cover and refrigerate, <br>
    make pizza the next evening (optimal) <br>
    or the day after that (still very good).</p>
<br>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <p>
        Water - 350 grams <br>
        Fine Sea Salt - 13 grams <br>
        Instant Dry Yeast - 1.5 grams (or Active Dry Yeast 2 grams) <br>
        Flour, preferrably 00 - 500 grams <br>
    </p>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <p> Measure and Combine the Ingredients. <br>
        Using your digital scale, measure 350 grams of 90° to 95°F (32° to 35°C) water into a 6-quart dough tub. <br>
        Measure 13 grams of fine sea salt, add it to the water, and stir or swish around in the tub until it’s dissolved. <br>
        Measure 1.5 grams (¾ of ½ teaspoon) of instant dried yeast. <br>
        Add the yeast to the water, let it rest there for a minute to hydrate, then swish it around until dissolved. <br>
        Add 500 grams of flour (preferably 00) to the water-salt-yeast mixture.<br>
        <br>
        Mix the Dough.<br>
        Mix by hand, first by stirring your hand around inside the dough tub to integrate the flour, water, salt, and yeast into a single mass of dough. <br>
        Then use the pincer method (see page 86) to cut the dough in sections with your hand, alternating with folding the dough to develop it back into a unified mass. <br>
        Continue for just 30 seconds to 1 minute. <br>
        The target dough temperature at the end of the mix is 8o°F (27°C); use your probe thermometer to check it. <br>
        <br>
        Knead and First Rise.<br>
        Let the dough rest for zo minutes, then knead it on a work surface with a very light dusting of flour for about 3o seconds to 1 minute. <br>
        The skin of the dough should be very smooth. <br>
        Place the dough ball seam side down in the lightly oiled dough tub. <br>
        Cover with a tight-fitting lid. <br>
        Hold the dough for 2 hours at room temperature (assuming 70° to 74°F/21° to 23°C) for the first rise. <br>
        <br>
        Shape. <br> 
        Divide the dough and shape it into dough balls. <br>
        Moderately flour a work surface about 2 feet wide. <br>
        With floured hands, gently ease the dough out of the tub. <br>
        With your hands still floured, pick up the dough and ease it back down onto the work surface in a somewhat even shape. <br>
        Dust the entire top of the dough with flour, then cut it into 3 or 5 equal-sized pieces, depending on the style of pizza. <br>
        Use your scale to get evenly sized dough balls. <br>
        Shape each piece of dough into a medium-tight round following the instructions on pages 88 to 91, working gently and being careful not to tear the dough. <br>
        There is no floor time for these dough balls before going into the refrigerator.<br>
        <br>
        Second Fermentation. <br>
        Put the dough balls on one or two lightly floured dinner plates, leaving space between them to allow for expansion.<br>
        Lightly flour the tops, tightly cover with plastic wrap, and put them into the refrigerator.<br>
        Refrigerate until ready to make pizza, either the next evening (ideal) or the day after (still good).<br>
        <br>
        Make Pizza. <br>
        Remove the dough balls from the fridge 60 to 90 minutes before making pizza.</p>
